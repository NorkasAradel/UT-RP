- Super Robot Construction
02 THE BURST's body grants her enormous strength and durability, as well as equally tremendous power output. Her advanced optics can see in all sorts of unusual lighting conditions, and can utilise infrared. She does not feel the effects of exhaustion and doesn't need to eat or drink to maintain herself, though she does need brief rest periods to avoid stressing out her system too much.

- FullFire Shooter States
When entering combat, 02 THE BURST enters FullFire Shooter States, redirecting power from non-combat functions to precision and speed. When in FullFire Shooter States, she can run at a max speed of 100m/s, exert 3 tons of force, and endure 50 tons in kind. 
In this state, she can hit a target moving at 30m/s within a range of 50m without missing, and the Burst Attacker and Burst Defender are activated.

- Burst Attacker
The Burst Attacker is an energy projectile weapon mounted in 02 THE BURST's fingers,

- Burst Defender
The Burst Defender is an all-range attack drone system mounted on, deployed from, and including the

- Final THE BURST
By pressing down on either side of the front of her belt, 02 THE BURST can execute a Final THE BURST. This sends his strength and speed into overdrive for one attack, but he is weakened after using it for the next five minutes. If used consecutively too many times, she will shut down from the strain.
 
- Machine Heart
02 THE BURST is powered by the Machine Heart system, which utilises a Human SOUL attached to a technomagical system that draws out its power to power the frame. It is also the core of 02 THE BURST's being, in an identical way to Humans and Monsters. When heavily damaged, 02 THE BURST can use her SOUL to repair her body by converting its energy into matter, though the process is unbelievably slow. It can take a day for 02 THE BURST to recover from minor damages to her plating, and weeks to months for major damage such as loss of a limb. In addition, she has to shut down her other systems while repairing herself, rendering her comatose.
02 THE BURST has a cyan SOUL of PATIENCE.
