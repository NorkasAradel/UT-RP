- Scorching Wind
Through an innate magical ability, Nines has the ability to ignite and control flames, as well as control airflow. He can ignite and control flames a maximum distance of 1m away from his body. The hotter and larger the flames are, the more physically taxing they are to maintain and control. He is also immune to fire, and is extremely heat resistant. When it comes to airflow manipulation, he can increase and decrease the speed of the wind, as well as change its direction and shape with incredible precision within a radius of 50m. He can stir these winds to up to a gale force of 200km/h, and ignite flames with a maximum temperature of 5000Â°C. Individually his wind and flames aren't very impressive, but when paired when his combined they become a highly dangerous, long-ranged incinerating force.

- Soldier Instinct
Nines has the instincts and training of a soldier engraved into his brain. He thinks quickly and tactically in combat, has an innate knowledge of strategy and tactics, and is capable of operating various tools and weapons with ease.

- Superhuman Physique
Nines' body is naturally above the peak of human capability. He is tougher, faster, stronger, and more endurant than a human at their physical peak, although only by a modest margin.

- Protopower Projector
This handgun-like prototype was stolen by Nines from the facility he and Robo escaped from when they woke up. Powered by an internal battery, it fires magical blasts that can have their output adjusted. The lowest setting merely stings a little, while the highest setting hurts (and kicks) like a mundane rifle round. The internal battery can store 75 shots before needing to be recharged, and needs to cool down for 3 seconds every 15 shots. Changing the shot lethality does not increase or decrease shot count. The Protopower Projector will passively recharge using its owner's SOUL energy while not in use, taking 1 hour to fully recharge from empty. Finally, the Protopower Projector is large and bulky, being roughly the size of a .44 magnum revolver. As such, it is hard to conceal carry it, and is normally carried openly in a quick-draw holster.

- SOUL
Like all humans, Nines has a SOUL. His is an orange soul of BRAVERY.
