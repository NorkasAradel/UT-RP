- Super Robot Construction
Robo's body grants him enormous strength and durability, as well as equally tremendous power output. His advanced optics can see in all sorts of unusual lighting conditions, and can utilise infrared. He does not feel the effects of exhaustion and doesn't need to eat or drink to maintain himself, though he does need brief rest periods to avoid stressing out his system too much.
 
- HalfHalf Fighter States
When entering combat, Robo enters HalfHalf Fighter States, redirecting power from non-combat functions to strength and speed. When in HalfHalf Fighter States, he can run at a max speed of 50m/s, exert 10 tons of force, and endure the same in kind.
 
- FullStrong Buster States
While in HalfHalf Fighter States or FullSpeed Dasher States, Robo can redirect power to strength, causing him to alter his forearm configuration, thereby entering FullStrong Buster States. Sacrificing speed for sheer physical power, Robo can run at a max speed of 5m/s, exert 100 tons of force, and endure the same in kind. Speed is hampered by being physically weighed down due to conversion of energy to extra technomuscle mass.
 
- FullSpeed Dasher States
While in HalfHalf Fighter States or FullStrong Buster States, Robo can redirect power to speed, causing him to alter his lower leg configuration, thereby entering FullSpeed Dasher States. Sacrificing physical power for sheer speed, Robo can run at a max speed of 200m/s, exert 1 ton of force, and endure the same in kind. Strength is hampered by redirecting energy from any given exerted blow to the Machine Heart utilising a technomagical process, so as to not rip apart the frame.
 
- Final THE NEXT
By pressing down on either side of the front of his belt, Robo can execute a Final THE NEXT. This sends his strength and speed into overdrive for one attack, but he is weakened after using it for the next five minutes. If used consecutively too many times, he will shut down from the strain.
 
- Machine Heart
Robo is powered by the Machine Heart system, which utilises a Human SOUL attached to a technomagical system that draws out its power to power the frame. It is also the core of Robo's being, in an identical way to Humans and Monsters. When heavily damaged, Robo can use his SOUL to repair his body by converting its energy into matter, though the process is unbelievably slow. It can take a day for Robo to recover from minor damages to his plating, and weeks to months for major damage such as loss of a limb. In addition, he has to shut down his other systems while repairing himself, rendering him comatose.
Robo has a purple SOUL of PERSEVERANCE.
