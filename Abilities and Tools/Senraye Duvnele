- Amateur Wizard
Having some latent magical talent, Senraye has been practicing her magic skills for nine years, ever since Monsterkind was freed from the Underground. However, she still has a long way to go, and at the moment she only knows a handful of spells. Her spells are mostly themed around paper, although she is working on some ink-themed spells as well. She can cast five spells per day, and she can dismiss a spell at will, which cancels its effects. Doing so prematurely still takes up a spell slot.
 
- Basic Magic: Pages
Like Monsterkind, Senraye can use magical projectiles in combat. This is a basic magical ability, and does not count as a spell. Her projectiles take the form of book pages, and she can summon ten at any one time. They move in a manner reminiscent of actual paper through the air, drifting this way and that, but at a much faster speed. On contact, they deal mild damage and disappear, with a pain level akin to getting stung by a wasp. Senraye can manipulate the path of these projectiles somewhat to create patterns in the way Monsters do, but she is limited in their flexibility and by her own ability. Senraye can also inscribe these pages with whatever she wants, and make them act like normal paper.
 
- Spell: Paper Plane
Senraye can create a paper plane that flies in a straight line for 5 seconds, at the speed one would expect a paper plane to fly, before being subject to regular physical laws thereafter. They take 3 seconds to fold, and Senraye can summon 5 with 1 cast. On contact, they deal moderate physical damage and disappear, with a pain level akin to being stabbed with a needle. Senraye can also inscribe these planes with whatever she wants, and make them act like normal paper.
 
- Spell: Paper Crane
Senraye can create a paper crane that can move autonomously for 5 minutes. It can perform tasks it could reasonably perform with its unusually flexible and durable papery appendages, and it can carry things that it could reasonably carry, up to 5 pounds in weight. It takes 10 seconds to fold, and Senray can summon 1 with 1 cast. It cannot attack or deal damage however. Senraye can also inscribe this crane with whatever she wants.
 
- Spell: Paper Scroll
Senraye can create a long scroll, with the durability of a length of rope. It is 50ft. in length. While being unrolled, Senraye can control its movement as if it was a projectile, and it follows a wide, curved path. Once it has been completely unrolled, it cannot be controlled anymore, and comes to rest. It can be split into three pieces vertically upon summoning but cannot be rebound. It takes 5 seconds to be rolled, and Senraye can summon 1 with 1 cast. It cannot deal damage however. Senraye can also inscribe this scroll with whatever she wants.
 
- Spell: Ink Inscriber
Senraye can inscribe her Spellnotebook without the need of a writing implement, and can inscribe the information within on a paper-like surface in the same manner. This spell has a range of 10ft. It takes a variable amount of time to inscribe in this manner, but it typically takes a half-second per letter. Up to 1000 words can be inscribed with one cast.
 
- Spellnotebook  
Senraye owns a notebook of around 5000 pages. It has a custom hard-cover, and is stored within a waterproofed leather protector which hangs off the waist. Senraye stores her observations, stories, spells, and musing inside this Spellnotebook, and it is very special to her.
 
- Spellstaff
Senraye channels her magic through a staff she fashioned from a tree she found on the edge of the Deepwoods. It is 4ft. in length, and is carved with cosmetic designs. The end is fashioned in the style of a simple dragon head, and there is a leather strip around the center that serves as a grip. While Senraye doesn't need this to cast spells, it is much harder for her to do so without it.
 
- SOUL
Like all humans, Senraye has a SOUL. Hers is a green soul of KINDNESS.
