INFINITY is the world's largest crime syndicate, . Formed several decades before the Underground opened up, but has its roots in far older organizations, having a lineage that goes back thousands of years. Formed by a mysterious individual known only as BEYOND, nothing is known about them beyond the bloody trail they carved through the criminal underworld's elite to form their organization from the ruins of some of the most powerful crime syndicates. From these ruins, BEYOND formed INFINITY.
While primarily in the business of arms dealing and weapons development, there isn't a single illicit market that INFINITY won't attempt to tap into. Funding all sorts of research, both legitimate and illegal, INFINITY works to remain even beyond the cutting-edge, utilizing their in-house team for their most secret and most morally bankrupt projects.
