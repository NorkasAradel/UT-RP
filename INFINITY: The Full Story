INFINITY is the world's largest crime syndicate, having branches in most major countries.
It was formed by an individual known only as BEYOND several decades before the Barrier was shattered, being the combination of several older crime syndicates with histories going back even thousands of years. The formation of INFINITY by BEYOND is something of a legend in the criminal underworld, as none know the precise details save for those closest to BEYOND themself. All that is known is that BEYOND seized several of the world's most powerful criminal organisations by force and merged them into INFINITY, so as to serve as a tool in their grand designs. 
INFINITY's core philosophy is one of power, BEYOND themself being known to impress upon their subordinates that those with power are the arbiters of justice and righteousness, and that INFINITY should be the ultimate justice over earth and heaven. To this end, INFINITY's primary goal is to seize control of Gelderth through force and subterfuge, so that their rule can be extended to the stars.
