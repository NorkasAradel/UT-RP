INFINITY is an organization operating around the world in the criminal underworld. Formed several decades before the Underground opened up, but has its roots in far older organizations, having a lineage that goes back thousands of years. Formed by a mysterious individual known only as THE FIRST, nothing is known about them beyond the bloody trail they carved through the criminal underworld's elite to form their organization from the ruins of some of the most powerful crime syndicates. They consolidated their power and formed INFINITY on their philosophy of justice being decided by those with power. 
With the stated goal of seizing the world and the stars beyond, THE FIRST, supported by their most trusted underling Dr. Monogarn, put INFINITY's now-vast resources to use by beginning an illicit weapons development program. Funding research both legitimate and illegitimate, INFINITY used the results of this research in various in-house weapons development programs, run by the most trusted of THE FIRST's inner circle.
